adbNetScan
=====================

adbNetScan is a command line binary coded in C# that scans your network for any Android device that is "ADB over network" enabled. It scans port 5555, which is the default port. If you have device that listens on another port, I will try to add support for other ports.

*Coded using MonoDevelop on Ubuntu 12.04

*Works on Windows, Linux, and MacOSX.
